# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

In this repo you will learn about Math and Python for Reinforcement Learning. We will be using the OpenAI/Farama Gym for our examples and SpinningUp lecture for our notes. Our lessons will be in the form of Jupyter Notebooks and PDFs documents with theory explanation. Following below is the list of lessons we will be covering.

- [ ] 1. Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

- [ ] 1.1. What is Reinforcement Learning?

- [ ] 1.2. What is state, action, reward?

- [ ] 1.3. What is expected return?

- [ ] 1.4. Implemmenting a simple RL algorithm in Python.
